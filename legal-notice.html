				<h3>Disclaimer</h3>
				<h4>Liability for content</h4>
				<p>The contents of my pages were created with the greatest care. However, I cannot guarantee the correctness, completeness and up-to-dateness of the contents. As a service provider, I am responsible for my own content on these pages in accordance with § 7 Para. 1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) under the general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, I am not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain unaffected by this. However, liability in this regard is only possible from the point in time at which a concrete infringement of the law becomes known. If I become aware of any such infringements, I will remove this content immediately.</p>
				<h4>Liability for links</h4>
				<p>My offer contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents I have no influence. Therefore, I cannot assume any guarantee for these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete indications of a legal violation. If I become aware of any legal violations, I will remove such links immediately.</p>
				<h4>Copyright</h4>
				<p>The content and works created by the site operators on these pages are subject to German copyright law. Duplication, processing, distribution and any kind of exploitation outside the limits of copyright law require the written consent of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this site are only permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform me accordingly. If I become aware of any infringements, I will remove such content immediately.</p>
				<h4>Privacy</h4>
				<p>The use of my website is generally possible without providing personal data. Insofar as personal data (for example, name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected on my site, this is always done, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent. I would like to point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have security gaps. Complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible. The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation by third parties for the purpose of sending advertising and information material not expressly requested is hereby expressly prohibited. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information, for example through spam mails.</p>
